# Neural-Network-with-Financial-Time-Series-Data
An evnet driven model that uses financial time series data with New York Times information to form a LSTM recurrent neural network.

# Versions
There are 3 models. The first 2 models are based on price and volume data alone. The third model is an event driven model that uses sentiment analysis on news data to predict the stock price. 

1. Prediction with 22 previous days

Filename: LSTM_Stock_prediction_20170507.ipynb

Currently not working, but the model is optimized.

2. Prediction with 22 previous days

Filename: LSTM_Stock_prediction_20170528(Quandl).ipynb

Using Quandl Database instead of pandas datareader. Not optimized.

3. Event driven model with 3 previous days (Using CSV file for price data)

Filename: Event_driven_LSTM_Stock_prediction.ipynb

Using News for sentiment analysis for that day.


# Future improvement:
1. Optimize hyperparameter
2. Technical indicator will be added to the features
3. More data will be trained
4. Quantopian Zipline will be used for backtesting
5. Twitter sentiment analysis will be added
6. More indexes will be included

# Result:
Lastest LSTM model result for 7 years of testing data that has not been trained:

2. Significant improvement in accuracy

29/04/2017 Sixth update
1. ^GSPC Data since 1970 has been added, more training data, higher accuracy
2. 7 years of test data 
3. Object oriented programming
4. Hyperparameters for dropout has been tested

08/05/2017 Seventh update
1. All Hyperparameters have been tested and results have been uploaded.
2. Fixed comment for the data loader
3. More technical analysis like volume, moving average and other indexes will be added

28/05/2017 Eighth update
1. Using Quandl instead of Pandas datareader
2. Correlation heatmap has been addded
3. Using Adjusted OHLCV for the network
4. All functions can be loaded from lstmstock.py
5. A Quandl api key is provided temporarily for those who do not own a quandl account
6. Moving averages have been added

02/10/2017 Nineth update (Big update)

![Alt text](https://github.com/BenjiKCF/Neural-Network-with-Financial-Time-Series-Data/blob/master/Photos/Dataframe.png)

1. Event driven analysis
2. Switched to Tensorflow LSTM model

# Future update
I have successfully applied technical Indicators (ie Stochastics Oscillator, MACD, ATR) to the model. I will combine it with the event driven one to create a larger model with better hyperparameter optimization.

Also, I have installed Quantopian Zipline locally, so that I can backtest the model. However, I do not have a trading strategy. Please feel free to contact me to share your thought.

# How to use Quandl
With this link, you should be able to get the historic price data of a particular stock after login. 
Use Export > Python > api key and insert the api key to your model.
