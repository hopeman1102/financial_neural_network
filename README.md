# Neural-Network-with-Financial-Time-Series-Data

# Introduction:

Time-series Data forms the most paramount part of the quantitative analysis. Today, with the huge amount of data available online as well as technological advancement, we can analyze large scale data with recurrent neural network easily. Most importantly, this neural network predicts the future movement of the index and achieves a reasonably well result (0.01RMSE on Test set data). In this example, we will predict the SP500.

# Content:

This script downloads the data of stock or indexes from the online provider, form a pandas DataFrame that contains open, high, low, close and is compatible with the TensorFlow library and Keras. The prediction is based on the open, high, low in the same day to predict the adjusted close price in the very last minute or hour. (This method maybe inappropriate because the high and low data may not be available until the very end of the day, new version of prediction will be provided to address this problem.) Finally, apply a neural network to it. Finally, a visualized graph will be presented to compare the accuracy of it.

# How it works:

The concept of this model is mimicking technical analysis which uses the past price as well as the current high, low in the same day to predict the closing price.

# Disadvantage of this model:
I believe in the  efficient market hypothesis (EMH) that price cannot be predicted based on previous price. And this model is breaking the rule of it since it uses high, low data in the same day, which should be a future data. I wish to improve it if I can get my hands on hourly market data from 9:30 to 16:00. 

# Future improvement:
1. Hourly data for this model.
2. Uses more fundamental data to predict the price of stock.
3. Sentiment analysis
4. Train the model with 3000 US stocks.
5. Deep Q learning for portfolio optimization and risk
6. Regularization will be added to avoid overfitting.
7. Quantopian Zipline will be used for backtesting
8. Auto selection for the best hyperparameter



# Result:
Lastest LSTM model result for 7 years of testing data that has not been trained:

Train Score: 0.00006 MSE (0.01 RMSE)

Test Score: 0.00029 MSE (0.02 RMSE)

# Hyperparameter
Currently, I am testing for the best hyperparameter for this model.

For dropout, the result is shown as below.

For epochs less than 100 would be ideal.

For number of neurons, [256, 256, 32, 1] and [512, 512, 32, 1] would be ideal for this model.

# Acknowledgement:
Thanks to google, I have created this neural network with tensorflow, which is an amazing tool that can run on any computer without using the google cloud database. The original tutorial for version 1 is on here, https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=iBs59GlXhIA and my LSTM prediction model is based on https://github.com/etai83/lstm_stock_prediction.
